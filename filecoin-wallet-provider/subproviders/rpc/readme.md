# rpc engine

This module is just for making and handling jsonrpc requests to the remote filecoin node. If we wanted to get fancy we could use MetaMask's [json-rpc-engine](https://github.com/MetaMask/json-rpc-engine) or we could just ship a minimal version of our own to start (we already _kind of_ started on one for our [block-explorer](https://github.com/openworklabs/lotus-explorer/blob/primary/src/index.js#L55)).
